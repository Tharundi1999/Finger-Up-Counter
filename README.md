# Finger-Up-Counter
Finger Up Counter This Python project uses computer vision techniques to detect and count the number of fingers a person shows to the camera. The program identifies the number of fingers raised and outputs the corresponding value in real-time. It's an ideal project to demonstrate image processing and hand-tracking algorithms.
